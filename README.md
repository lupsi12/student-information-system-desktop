# Project Student Information System Desktop

## About the Project

This project aims to match students and professors based on their criteria in the most appropriate way. Students and professors can make requests depending on their interests and situations, and course registration will be made when these requests are approved. The system will operate in two stages: in the first stage, students and professors will make the selection by mutual agreement, and in the second stage, those who cannot reach an agreement will be automatically assigned to professors.

## Features

- **Automatic Assignment:** Automatically assigning students who cannot reach an agreement to professors based on random assignment, GPA, or specific course criteria.
